# PowerGuard System Architecture

## High-Level Design (HLD)

### Overview

PowerGuard is an AI-powered system app designed to optimize battery and network usage on Android
devices through intelligent usage pattern analysis. Installed as a privileged system app, it
analyzes app behavior, resource consumption patterns, and user habits to implement targeted
optimizations that extend battery life and reduce data usage.

### Core Capabilities

1. **Custom Usage Pattern Recognition**
   - Collects and analyzes app usage data, battery consumption, and network traffic
   - Identifies patterns in resource consumption over time
   - Detects apps with abnormal resource usage

2. **Intelligent Optimization**
   - Applies targeted optimization strategies based on detected patterns
   - Adapts restrictions based on device state (battery level, charging status)
   - Provides automated and user-guided optimization options

3. **Privileged System Integration**
   - Utilizes system-level permissions for direct control over resource-consuming processes
   - Implements fallback strategies when certain permissions are unavailable
   - Integrates with native Android features like Data Saver

## Low-Level Design (LLD)

### Core Components

1. **PowerGuardService**
   - Long-running foreground service that collects data and applies optimizations
   - Monitors system state (battery level, network connectivity)
   - Schedules periodic data collection and analysis
   - Implements adaptive permission handling based on app installation location

2. **Data Collection System**
   - Monitors battery statistics via BatteryManager
   - Tracks app usage through UsageStatsManager
   - Collects network usage data when permissions are available
   - Implements data aggregation to minimize storage requirements

3. **Pattern Recognition System**
   - Analyzes historical usage data to identify patterns
   - Categorizes apps based on resource consumption profiles
   - Maintains usage pattern database for consistent optimization

4. **Optimization Engine**
   - Implements multiple optimization strategies:
      - Force stopping high battery-consuming apps when battery is low
      - Using Data Saver integration for network optimization
      - Battery optimization requests for background activity reduction
   - Adapts strategies based on available permissions

### Implementation Details

#### Battery Optimization

PowerGuard implements a multi-tiered approach to battery optimization:

1. **High Battery Drain Detection**
   - Monitors battery usage per app
   - Identifies apps consuming >5% battery
   - Triggers optimization when battery level falls below 20%

2. **Optimization Actions**
   - For critical situations:
      - Force stops high-draining apps when appropriate permissions are available
   - For preventive management:
      - Applies battery optimization flags to reduce background activity
   - When permissions are limited:
      - Provides user notifications with recommended actions

#### Network Optimization

PowerGuard implements a comprehensive approach to network management:

1. **Data Usage Monitoring**
   - Tracks background and foreground data usage
   - Identifies apps consuming >10MB in background

2. **Multi-layered Control Strategy**
   - **Data Saver Integration**:
      - Leverages Android's built-in Data Saver feature
      - Guides users to configure optimal Data Saver settings
   - **App Inactivity Management**:
      - Marks high data-consuming apps as inactive when not in use
      - Targets apps with high background data usage
   - **Last Resort Control**:
      - Force stops apps with extreme data usage (>50MB)
      - Only applied in critical situations

### Permission Management

PowerGuard implements adaptive behavior based on available permissions:

1. **Permission Detection**
   - Checks permission status on service startup
   - Verifies installation location (priv-app vs. app)
   - Adapts functionality based on available permissions

2. **Permission Utilization**
   - With full permissions:
      - Direct system control for resource optimization
      - Complete battery and network statistics access
   - With limited permissions:
      - Fallback to user-guided optimization
      - Leverages standard Android features

### API Compatibility

PowerGuard is designed to work across multiple Android versions (API 24+) with adaptive strategies:

1. **Core Functionality Consistency**
   - Battery optimization works consistently across API levels
   - Network optimization adapts to available system features
   - Permission handling adjusts based on installation method

2. **Cross-Version Adaptation**
   - Implements version-specific optimizations where needed
   - Provides appropriate user guidance for manual configuration
   - Maintains core functionality regardless of API restrictions

## Conclusion

PowerGuard delivers custom usage pattern-based battery and network optimization through:

1. **Continuous monitoring** of system resources and app behavior
2. **Pattern-based analysis** to identify resource-intensive applications
3. **Multi-layered optimization** strategies adapted to available permissions
4. **Intelligent decision making** based on device state and usage history

This architecture enables PowerGuard to provide effective resource optimization across different
Android versions and permission levels, balancing system-level control with user-guided strategies.
