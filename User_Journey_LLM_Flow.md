## Journey Stages

### 1. User Activity & Settings
- **User Actions**:
  - Normal device usage (apps, network, processing)
  - Configuration of optimization preferences
  - Setting optimization thresholds
- **System Inputs**:
  - Usage patterns detection
  - User preference recording
  - Priority settings capture

### 2. System State Detection
- **Monitoring**:
  - Battery level and drain rate
  - Network usage and connectivity type
  - CPU load and temperature
  - App activity and resource consumption
- **Triggers**:
  - Low battery detection (below 20%)
  - High data usage detection (above threshold)
  - Processing bottlenecks
  - Resource conflicts

### 3. LLM Analysis & Decision
- **Resource Type Determination**:
  - System analyzes collected data
  - LLM identifies primary resource concern:
    - Battery (if level low, drain high)
    - Network (if data usage high, connection limited)
    - Processing (if CPU load high, temperature concerning)

- **Category Classification**:
  - Based on resource type, LLM selects optimization approach:
    - For Battery: Background restrictions, app hibernation
    - For Network: Data saver, background data limits
    - For Processing: Process priority, thermal management

- **Conditional Execution Logic**:
  - LLM evaluates specific conditions:
    - Time of day and user activity patterns
    - Critical vs. non-critical applications
    - User override settings
    - Previous optimization effectiveness

### 4. Optimization Implementation
- **Action Execution**:
  - System implements LLM-decided optimizations:
    - Restricting background processes
    - Limiting network for selected apps
    - Adjusting processing priorities
    - Setting data usage thresholds

- **Adaptive Measures**:
  - System applies progressive optimization intensity:
    - Gentle optimizations when resource issues are minor
    - Aggressive optimizations in critical situations
    - Emergency measures when thresholds are breached

### 5. Results & Notifications
- **User Visibility**:
  - Notification of applied optimizations
  - Resource savings indicators
  - Current system status
  - Expected benefits (e.g., "2 hours of battery life extended")

- **Action Transparency**:
  - Details on modified settings
  - Affected applications
  - Override options

### 6. User Feedback & Adaptation
- **Interaction Options**:
  - User accepts, modifies, or rejects optimizations
  - Preference updates based on feedback
  - Custom rules creation

- **Learning Loop**:
  - LLM records user responses
  - Adaptation of future decisions
  - Personalization of optimization approach
